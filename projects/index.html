                    <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) [Сергей Михайлович Прокудин-Горский, to his Russian friends] 
                        was a man well ahead of his time. Convinced, as early as 1907, that color photography was the wave of the future, 
                        he won Tzar's special permission to travel across the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of everything 
                        he saw including the only color portrait of Leo Tolstoy. And he really photographed everything: people, buildings, 
                        landscapes, railroads, bridges... thousands of color pictures! His idea was simple: record three exposures of every 
                        scene onto a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter.  I took the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images
                    and used image processing techniques to automatically align them on top of each other, producing full color photographs. </p>

                    <p>Hybrid images are static images that change in interpretation as a function of the viewing distance. 
                        The basic idea is that high frequency tends to dominate perception when it is available, but, at a distance, 
                        only the low frequency (smooth) part of the signal can be seen. By blending the high frequency portion of one 
                        image with the low-frequency portion of another, you get a hybrid image that leads to different interpretations 
                        at different distances.  I used 2D convolutions to develop hybrid images and seamlessly blend images together at 
                        different frequency levels.

                    <p>Images of faces are aligned by selecting corresponding points between them, i.e. eyes to eyes, mouth to mouth, 
                        chin to chin, ears to ears, etc.  We can compute the Delaunay triangulation across these points, and find the 
                        mean point set between two images.  Then, we use the affine transformation matrix to warp each triangle 
                        from the original image to the new average shape.  We interpolate pixel values using an inverse-warp.  In this 
                        project, I produced a "morph" animation of two different faces, computed the mean of a population of faces,
                        and extrapolated from a population mean to create a caricature of myself.  I created a facial coordinate space and
                        used Principal Component Analysis to find the eigenvectors with the largest singular values.
